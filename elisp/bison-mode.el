;;;;Commentary

;;;; I wrote this since I saw one mode for yacc files out there roaming the
;;;; world.     I was daunted by the fact the it was written in 1990, and emacs
;;;; has evolved so much since then (this I assume based on its evolution since
;;;; i started using it).     So I figured if i wanted one, I should make it
;;;; myself.     Please excuse idiosyncrasies, as this was my first major mode
;;;; of this kind.     The indentation code may be a bit weird, I am not sure,
;;;; it was my first go at doing emacs indentation, so I look at how other
;;;; modes did it, but then basically did what I thought was right

;;;; I hope this is useful to other hackers, and happy Bison/Yacc hacking
;;;; If you have ideas/suggestions/problems with this code, I can be reached at
;;;; beuscher@eecs.tulane.edu

;;;; Bison Sections:
;;;; there are five sections to a bison file (if you include the area above the
;;;; C declarations section.     most everything in this file either does
;;;; actions based on which section you are deemed to be in, or based on an
;;;; assumption that the function will only be called from certain sections.
;;;; the function `bison--section-p' is the section parser

;;;; Indentation:
;;;; indentations are done based on the section of code you are in.    there is
;;;; a procedure `bison--within-braced-c-expression-p' that checks for being in
;;;; C code.    if you are within c-code, indentations should occur based on
;;;; how you have your C indentation set up.     i am pretty sure this is the
;;;; case.
;;;; there are four variables, which control bison indentation within either
;;;; the bison declarations section or the bison grammar section
;;;; `bison-rule-separator-column'
;;;; `bison-rule-separator-column'
;;;; `bison-decl-type-column'
;;;; `bison-decl-token-column'

;;;; flaw: indentation works on a per-line basis, unless within braced C sexp,
;;;; i should fix this someday
;;;; and to make matters worse, i never took out c-indent-region, so that is
;;;; still the state of the `indent-region-function' variable

;;;; Electricity:
;;;; by default, there are electric -colon, -pipe, -open-brace, -close-brace,
;;;; -semicolon, -percent, -less-than, -greater-than
;;;; the indentation caused by these work closely with the 4 indentation
;;;; variables mentioned above.
;;;; any of these can be turned off individually by setting the appropriate
;;;; `bison-electric-...' variable.     or all of them can be turned off by
;;;; setting `bison-all-electricity-off'

;;;; todo:  should make available a way to use C-electricity if in C sexps
